        <h6 class="blue">What is BlueOS?</h6>
        <p>BlueOS is my very, very, very bad customization of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>. It is mostly a learning project... <br>
          (Using the archiso package from the official repos.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <h6 class="blue">Who makes BlueOS?</h6>
        <p>BurnyLlama, me, makes BlueOS. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/BurnyLlama/blueos">GitHub</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <h6 class="blue">Who should use BlueOS?</h6>
        <p>Well... Simply put... Noone would want to use it, unless they would just like a simple way of installing Arch Linux... <br>
          (Or if they, for some reason, actually likes some features that I may add... But then again... They would all be available on GitHub and would work with any Arch installation...)</p>

    <h3 class="blue text-center">Downloads:</h3>
    <p>Currently there are no downloads, as I have yet to make a stable enough build.</p>
    <p>Although, you could go to <a href="https://github.com/BurnyLlama/blueos">GitHub</a> and compile a beta build yourself....</p>
